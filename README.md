# Xaramin Project â€“ Grocery List App
The Grocery List App is an Xamarin app developed by me to help my wife and I keep our grocery shopping list synced.

The app is based on a ListView (C#) and the data is synced using Google Firebase Database.

Future features to be added include:
- Add images to each grocery item;
- Use Firebase Realtime feature (so the "Refresh" button would not be needed anymore);
- Implement add new grocery item from the app (right now I need to manually add new items directly in Firebase).
